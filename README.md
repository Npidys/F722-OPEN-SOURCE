# F722-OPEN-SOURCE
OPEN SOURCE STM32F722 BASED AUTOPILOT
# Open-Source Flight Controller Project

Welcome to the Open-Source Flight Controller Project! This project aims to provide an affordable, fully open-source flight controller platform for the drone community. While not cutting-edge, this design is ideal for development, experimentation, and contributing to firmware like Betaflight and iNav.

## Overview
This flight controller is designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind, allowing developers to explore UAV control systems without financial barriers. The hardware design files and firmware are released as open-source to foster community collaboration and innovation.

### Hardware Specifications:
- **MCU**: STM32F722
- **IMUs**: Dual ICM-42688-P (or replaceable with 1 IMU and 1 Compass)
- **Barometer**: BMP388/390
- **On-Screen Display (OSD)**
- **Flash Memory**: 128M
- **ESC Outputs**: 4
- **UART Outputs**: 4  
- **I2C Outputs**: 1  
- **GPS Outputs**: 1  
- **AUX Outputs**: 4
- **Compatibility**: S.Bus
- **Input Voltage**: 7.4V-30V

### Project Resources
- **PCB Design**: KiCad PCB files will be available for full hardware design.
- **Firmware**: Custom firmware for Betaflight/iNav integration.
- **Documentation**: Hardware overview, schematics, and setup guides.

## Collaboration
I'm currently seeking developers with Betaflight/iNav experience to help refine and enhance the firmware. This is a passion project, and no financial incentives are involved.
